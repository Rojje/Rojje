### ‚öîÔ∏è Mission & Doctrine  

I‚Äôm Elian Mendoza, at the beginning of my journey in **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision**.  
My doctrine is **‚ÄúBurning the ships‚Äù**: moving forward with no retreat, documenting each step of the way.  

This repository is not a showcase of finished products, but rather my **campaign diary**, where even a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù stands as proof of progress.

### üî• The Forge (Project Philosophy)  

In this forge, every repository is a step in the journey.  

You won‚Äôt find ‚Äúfinished products‚Äù here, but rather **battle evidence**: from the first *Hello World* to tackling increasingly complex problems.  

Each commit is a small victory. Each project, a new milestone forward.

### üìì Campaign Log (Journaling)  

- **Day 1:** Hello World in Python.  
- **Week 1:** Exploring NumPy.  
- **Week 2:** First battles with Pandas and data analysis.  
*(The list will grow with every conquest.)*
